# NMS-Util
 No Man's Sky Base Building Utility Addon for Blender
 
 Welcome to the NMS Util, a base building add-on in Blender, that adds object manipulation utilities when base building in Blender for No Man's Sky.

The following features are included:
 
Floor Creator –      Creates round or square floors quickly and efficiently, with fine tuning of edges
                     adjustable width x length or diameter.  Includes building allowances for 
                     multiple floors at various heights
                     
Object Circle Creator – Build the perfect circle of any object.  
                        Start with the reference object, rotate it the way you want and create a perfectly spaced circle, 
                        including fine tune adjustment
                        
NMS Wiring Text – Allows wiring and connectors to automatically follow any text you create 
                  (not perfect, but does all the heavy lifting!)
                  
Object Manipulation – Allows move/copy of objects & their attributes (scale, rotation) between the 
                      Active object (one with the orange origin) and one or more selected objects. 
                      Also Includes object alignment & distribution modules, as well as an align faces module.
                      
Object Replacement -  Replaces all selected object(s) with the Active object with one mouse click.

Object Along Curve –  Enhanced Duplicate Object Along Curve module that gives you more control 
                      over orientation of the object, spacing along the curve, and adjustments on the fly
